## Recap

- Functions in Rust are a powerful way to encapsulate and organize code.
- They can be executed by calling them.
- Parameters allow functions to work with specific data, and functions can optionally return data.
- By using functions, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
- They help break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Additionally, functions promote code reuse, as you can call them multiple times throughout your program.
- Remember to choose meaningful names for your functions and parameters.
- Document their purpose and usage using comments or docstrings.
- This will make your code easier to understand for both yourself and other developers who may work on your project in the future.
