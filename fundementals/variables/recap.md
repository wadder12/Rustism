## Recap

Variables are a fundamental concept in programming that allow us to store and manipulate data. In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.

Using variables can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of our code. They provide a way to give meaningful names to values, making our code more understandable and self-explanatory.

By utilizing variables, we can also perform operations on them, such as assigning values to other variables. This flexibility allows us to build complex algorithms and solve problems efficiently.

Remember, when working with variables in Rust, it's important to consider their immutability and choose appropriate names that accurately describe their purpose.
